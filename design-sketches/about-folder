This folder contains three subfolders. The first one includes a C++ code that I wrote almost a year ago when I only knew C++. It gave me the idea of reconstructing the program with my current knowledge.
The second folder contains a 3D cube code that helped me in building this program, and I put it here so that if I need to build a cube in the future with just CSS, I can easily access it in one place.
The third folder includes two initial sketches of this program, showing how I got from one thing to another :)

-   Update: I lost the C++ code and only have the .exe file :\_(
